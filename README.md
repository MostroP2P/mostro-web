## Mostro Web

Super early version of a web client for the [Mostro](https://github.com/MostroP2P/mostro) P2P System.

This project is a web interface that facilitates peer-to-peer bitcoin trading over the lightning network ‚ö°Ô∏è using nostr ü¶©. The lightning network is a layer 2 scaling solution for bitcoin that enables fast and low-cost transactions.

### Configuration - (Dev only üßë‚Äçüíª)

```
RELAYS=<comma-separated-list-of-relay-urls>

SECRET_KEY=<the-user-secret-key>
```
