## Mostro Web

Super early version of a web client for the [Mostro](https://github.com/MostroP2P/mostro) P2P System.

This project is a web interface that facilitates peer-to-peer bitcoin trading over the lightning network ‚ö°Ô∏è using nostr ü¶©. The lightning network is a layer 2 scaling solution for bitcoin that enables fast and low-cost transactions.

```
RELAYS=<comma-separated-list-of-relay-urls>
MOSTRO_PUB_KEY=<public-key-of-your-mostro-instance>
SECRET_KEY=<the-user-secret-key>
```

### Prerequisites

* Generate som `nsec` and `npub` keys using [nostrtool](https://nostrtool.com/) or [Rana](https://github.com/grunch/rana) and paste it in a new `.env` file under `MOSTRO_PUB_KEY` and `SECRET_KEY` keys
* Set RELAYS to `ws://localhost:7000` in the `.env` file
* Run `yarn install`

### You're now ready to go.
With `docker` and `polar` already running then do...
1. In `mostro` folder 
    ```bash
    $ ./init_db.sh
    $ cargo run
    $ cd relay
    $ docker compose up -d
    ```
2. In `mostro-web` folder
    ```bash
    $ yarn dev
    ```
That's it! üéâ

### Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# Production build and version generation
# There's no need to run this every time, but run this at least once 
# before running `npm run dev`
$ npm run build

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
